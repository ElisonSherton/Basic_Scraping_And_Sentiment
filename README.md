# Basic Web Scraping And Sentiment Gauging

 Web Scraping using **BeautifulSoup** and sentiment analysis using **nltk**
 
**Harrison Kinsley** has a Youtube channel by the name **sentdex** and he makes videos about python spanning across ML, AI, basic python, openCV, basic game programming etc. I aim to gauge the popularity of his videos based on Machine Learning from this ML playlist:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v based on the Like to Dislike Ratio of the videos contained in this playlist

Once all the titles of these videos are scraped, I want to manually label these as good or bad videos based on their like to dislike ratio and then run a classification algorithm (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers) to figure out the basics of natural language processing using Natural Language Toolkit in python aka nltk.

The code in **Scrape_And_Analyze.ipynb** is replete with comments where necessary and explains the intuition / thought process behind the steps executed in the notebook.

Refer these videos to learn BeautifulSoup and nltk basics in a jiffy:
